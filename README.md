## Overview

This Java program allows a user to enter the name of a student and the marks obtained in multiple subjects. It calculates the average marks and the Grade Point Average (GPA) based on the entered marks. The program then outputs the student's name, average marks, GPA, and corresponding grade based on the GPA.
